# Mexico250210 ‚Äì Full Stack Training Cohort

This repository contains the projects, demos, and study notes developed during a **full-stack engineering training cohort** I led in Mexico (Spring 2025).  
It showcases end-to-end examples across **Java/Spring Boot, React, AWS/DevOps, and testing practices**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Installation Guides/**  
  Step-by-step environment setup for Java, Node.js, Spring Boot, React, Docker, and AWS deployment.  

- **Project Iterations/**  
  Incremental versions of student projects (Todo App, Loan Management System, etc.) highlighting progression from basic CRUD ‚Üí layered architecture ‚Üí cloud-ready deployments.  

- **demos/**  
  Code demos on key concepts including:
  - Session management and authentication  
  - 3NF database design & SQL scripts  
  - RESTful APIs with Spring Boot  
  - Password hashing (bcrypt)  
  - Javalin + Jackson integration for JSON/LocalDate  
  - Dockerized apps hosted on EC2/RDS  

- **review-notes/**  
  Weekly review notes, study guides, and presentation guidelines. Includes material on:
  - DevOps (CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, AWS)  
  - SaaS vs. PaaS vs. IaaS  
  - Cloud hosting strategies  
  - React `useContext` for auth, state persistence, and testing
